M5 - W5 Assignment

Working with time series is an important skill for a data scientist. Many of the data you may need to work with are either time series or have some form of time element to them. When you think about financial markets, transactions happening in stores, banks, ecommerce, orders and workload forecasting– these all are examples of time series problems.
In this assignment, you will work with forecasting sales in retail stores.
•	Download the Retail Data Analytics data from Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/manjeetsingh/retaildatasetLinks to an external site.. Download the three data sets: one on stores, one on features and one on sales.
•	Merge them, do the appropriate cleaning and perform a basic EDA to understand the dataset.
•	Explore the data and perform visualizations you deem appropriate. Make sure to pay attention to the target – the weekly sales -- and how it relates to other features. Do you see some seasonality in the target and, if yes, then what kind?
•	Train a model (or models) that predicts the weekly sales in a department store. This is a time series problem so be careful with the train-test split. Evaluate the model you have trained and reason about how the store managers can use your forecast to better anticipate sales fluctuations.
Submit your solution in a Jupyter notebook and a link to a GitHub repo where you have also uploaded your code.
